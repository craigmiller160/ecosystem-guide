# Craigmiller160 Ecosystem Guide

My application & personal development ecosystem has been growing so much over the years. This GitHub account has a mix of reference projects, course work, and then some "real deal" items that I really do want to keep track of. This project intends to do just that.

## Sections

[Infrastructure](./INFRASTRUCTURE.md) = Information about the infrastructure that I have built for this ecosystem.

[Applications](./APPLICATIONS.md) = All the full applications I have written.

[JVM Utilities](./JVM_UTILITIES.md) = Utility libraries I've written to support my JVM-based projects.

[NPM Utilities](./NPM_UTILITIES.md) = Utility libraries I've written to support my NPM projects.

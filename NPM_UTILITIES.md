# NPM Utilities

This is a section covering all the utility libraries I've written to support my NPM projects.

## ESLint & Prettier

I have had an ongoing effort to standardize my ESLint & Prettier projects. This has resulted in all of these libraries that can easily be combined together by extending their respective configurations

[@craigmiller160/eslint-config-js](https://github.com/craigmiller160/eslint-config-js) = Basic ESLint Config for JavaScript projects.

[@craigmiller160/prettier-config](https://github.com/craigmiller160/prettier-config) = Basic Prettier Config for JavaScript & TypeScript projects.

[@craigmiller160/eslint-config-prettier](https://github.com/craigmiller160/eslint-config-prettier) = ESLint configuration to integrate Prettier.

[@craigmiller160/eslint-config-ts](https://github.com/craigmiller160/eslint-config-ts) = Basic ESLint Config for TypeScript projects.

[@craigmiller160/eslint-config-react](https://github.com/craigmiller160/eslint-config-react) = Basic ESLint Config for React projects.

[@craigmiller160/eslint-config-jest](https://github.com/craigmiller160/eslint-config-jest) = ESLint configuration for Jest.

## Babel

Here are libraries with pre-build Babel configs to use in projects.
